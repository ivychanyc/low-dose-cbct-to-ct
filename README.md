# CBCT-to-CT cycleGAN

This PyTorch implementation is adapted from the original cycleGAN open source for the purpose of maping low dose CBCT images into CT images. If you would like to optimize from the original hyperparameters, check out the original cycleGAN at https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
